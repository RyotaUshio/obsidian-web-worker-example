# Obsidian Sample Plugin

This is a minimal working example of building an [Obsidian.md](https://obsidian.md/) plugin using [web workers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Workers_API/Using_web_workers).

It utilizes an esbuild plugin https://github.com/mitschabaude/esbuild-plugin-inline-worker.

Thank you https://github.com/blacksmithgu/datacore for letting me know about it.
